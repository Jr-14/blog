      <description>I stumbled upon this problem practicing Competitive Programming on codeforces. The problem can be found here. Feel free to try it yourself &amp;#x1f604;.
What I like about this problem is it does not require any specialised math or algorithms and data structures knowledge. It only requires some insight and understanding into what the question is truly asking.
Quick summary of the problem. There are $n$ containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from $1$ to $n$.</description>

      <description>I initially attempted to follow the setup of mathematics in content management section of Hugo. Not knowing how it worked, I assumed I can copy and paste these configurations straight out of the box, but this did not work. I wanted to run and I wanted to run fast without first understanding the underlying architecture of Hugo
In comes a bit of googling and running into this article by Misha Brukman in Writing Math with Hugo.</description>
