      <description>I initially attempted to follow the setup of mathematics in content management section of Hugo. Not knowing how it worked, I assumed I can copy and paste these configurations straight out of the box, but this did not work. I wanted to run and I wanted to run fast without first understanding the underlying architecture of Hugo
In comes a bit of googling and running into this article by Misha Brukman in Writing Math with Hugo.</description>

      <title>Using Hugo to generate my static blog</title>

      <description>I initially created a small blog using Svelte + Firebase to generate a static website for my blog, however the development effort required to build up a static website caused too much friction. I wanted to create blog posts fast, and found Hugo to support Code blocks with syntax highlighting out of the box.
Example Code block:
#include&amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt; using namespace std; int main() { cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;#34;Hello, World&amp;#34; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; endl; return 0; } Using math notations using in Markdown using LaTeX or TeX requires some configuration and research, in which I will go into in the the next blog post.</description>
