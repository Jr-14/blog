## Using Hugo
I initially created a small blog using Svelte + Firebase to generate a static website for my blog, however the
development effort required to build up a static website caused too much friction. I wanted to create blog posts fast,
and found Hugo to support Code blocks with syntax highlighting out of the box.

Example Code block:

```c++
#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Using math notations using in Markdown using LaTeX or TeX requires some configuration and research, in which I will go into in the
the next blog post.
